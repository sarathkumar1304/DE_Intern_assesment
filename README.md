# DE_Intern_assesment

# Assignment
Write an automated script using Python that sends a periodic data summary to Slack (preferred) or to an Email address. You can get a free slack account and establish web-hooks to post the summary. For this exercise, you can post the monthly trend analysis of the number of covid deaths from top 3 states. You can be creative and figure out some different mechanism (other than slack/email) as well - the goal is to send updates to a group of users about important metrics periodically.

## The output should be like:
Top 3 states with the highest number of COVID-19 deaths for the month of June:

State New York: 918476 deaths, 26.25% of total US deaths

State New Jersey: 388821 deaths, 11.11% of total US deaths

State Massachusetts: 228975 deaths, 6.54% of total US deaths
